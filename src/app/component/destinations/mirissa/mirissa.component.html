  <p class="title">Awesome things to do in Mirissa</p>
  <br>
  <p class="description">
    Mirissa is a small town and a beach resort area in the South of Sri Lanka on the Indian ocean. Mirissa was
    formed at first as a purely tourist resort area, and then there appeared a modest urban infrastructure. Houses
    of local residents are almost there, everyone is focused only on tourism. In addition to tourism, the village
    lives on fishing, much of which, again, is focused on resort guests. The first tourist hotel here appeared in
    1980, and the place was so successful that in the 90-ies started to develop rapidly, and today has become one
    of the most attractive beach resorts in the South. Come here for excellent beaches, calm surroundings,
    solitude and idleness. If you compare Mirissa with the other two most popular resorts of the South – Navauto
    and the Golden Sands, here is much quieter. Compared to them, Mirissa is a real wilderness, but this is the
    main feature of the resort. But there is a reason it is in Mirissa rush the tourists is the blue whales.

  <p class="subTitle">Visit secret beach</p>
  <p class="description">
    Aside from Mirissa Beach, there’s another beautiful spot for an afternoon of sun bathing and drinking coconuts
    available. Secret Beach is roughly a 30 minute walk from Mirissa town, but easily doable. It’s possible to
    reach the beach by bike or local tuk tuk, however the road is extremely damaged so please be careful. We’d
    definitely recommend walking! Secret Beach is the perfect place to get away from the crowds, or to enjoy a
    drink at sunset. The beach itself is absolutely stunning. A tiny bay with deck chairs available and food and
    drink served from Secret Beach Bar.

  <p class="subTitle">Climb Coconut Tree Hill</p>
  <p class="description">
    Coconut Tree Hill must be the most popular Instagram spot in Mirissa. This small hill is literally covered in
    Coconut trees and makes for a really beautiful photo. Of course, as with any spot this popular, it does get
    very busy especially during the day. The hill is in the perfect spot to watch a sunset, but as you can imagine,
    it can be very crowded at this time. During sunrise is the least busy time and if you get there before 7 am
    you could be lucky enough to get the place you yourself! Although the spot has become famous for the Instagram
    photo it’s also a great place to relax and watch the ocean. Just be sure to watch out for falling coconuts! The
    climb to the top takes around 2 minutes and there is a small parking area for tuk-tuks and scooters at the
    bottom.

  <p class="subTitle">Visit Parrot Rock</p>
  <p class="description">
    Parrot Rock is a large rock that sits at the end of Mirissa Bay. From the top of the rock, you get amazing
    views of Mirissa Beach. You only need 30 minutes or so at Parrot Rock to take in the stunning views, however,
    you could spend a lot more time in the rock pools below. These pools provide a great calm area to both swim
    and snorkel! Parrot Rock is a completely free thing to do in Mirissa and access to the rock is easy from the
    main beach. A visit to Parrot rock won’t be the most amazing thing you do in Mirissa but it’s so close to town
    you really should do it.

  <p class="subTitle">The Doctors House</p>
  <p class="description">
    Ready for a great afternoon party with surf vibes? The Doctors House is the place to visit! It is a 15-minute
    drive out of town and highly recommended to visit. The big garden has the perfect laid-back vibe, great food,
    drinks, and live music.

  <p class="subTitle">Whale watching</p>
  <p class="description">
    One thing Mirissa prides itself on is its marine life! With blue whales, sperm whales and dolphins known to
    hover around the coastline from November until the end of April, whale watching is certainly one of the top
    things to do in Mirissa. The very best months are March and April for blue whale sightings. We also recommend
    heading out as early as possible as the sea is usually calm in the morning and rougher in the afternoon. With so
    many companies to choose from, Island Breeze Mirissa is one of the highest rated in the area. And you can check
    availability, prices and book in advance with them here. The duration of their trips are 4 hours long, starting
    at around 6am, and ‘’with a strong possibility of spotting whales and dolphins in their natural habitat’’
    promised, you won’t be disappointed.
